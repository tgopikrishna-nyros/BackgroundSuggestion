# BackgroundSuggestion
General Information: 
This application is to identify colours in an uploaded image. 
Based on identified colours, Machine Learning Algorithm will find out major occupied colour in image and suggests 
suitable background colours

Development Information: 
Bootstrap, Python-Django and Machine Learning(Artificial Intelligence) are used to develop this application. 
To develop this application, we used KMeans Clustering Algorithm. 
KMeans algorithm in Machine Learning is a clustering purpose algorithm. 
This algorithm is used to deal with Unsupervised data(Unlabelled). 
we used KMeans to identify the colour clusters and determine centroids to each colour. 
KMeans will divide each colour into different clusters as first step then it decides centroid to each cluster. 
We need to label each cluster to separate.
